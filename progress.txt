Created vitest.config.ts with comprehensive test configuration:
- Merges with existing vite.config using mergeConfig for plugin consistency
- Test environment set to happy-dom for browser simulation
- Globals enabled for describe/it/expect (no imports needed in tests)
- Setup file configured to point to ./vitest.setup.ts
- Include pattern: src/**/*.{test,spec}.{ts,tsx}
- Exclude patterns: node_modules, dist, .output, convex, config files
- Coverage provider: v8 with text/json/html/lcov reporters
- Coverage thresholds: 70% for lines/functions/branches/statements
- Thread pool configured for parallelized test execution
- Path aliases (~/) automatically resolved via vite-tsconfig-paths plugin

Verification completed:
✅ vitest.config.ts file created in project root
✅ Config successfully merges with vite.config
✅ Vitest recognizes configuration without errors
✅ Include/exclude patterns working correctly
✅ No deprecation warnings (updated for Vitest 4)
✅ Changes committed to git

Next task: Configuration - Create vitest.setup.ts
