Next task: Configuration - Create vitest.config.ts

### Task 2: Configuration - vitest.config.ts ✅ COMPLETED
**Date:** 2026-01-17
**Commit:** 0d80546

Created vitest.config.ts with comprehensive test configuration:
- Merges with existing vite.config using mergeConfig for plugin consistency
- Test environment set to happy-dom for browser simulation
- Globals enabled for describe/it/expect (no imports needed in tests)
- Setup file configured to point to ./vitest.setup.ts
- Include pattern: src/**/*.{test,spec}.{ts,tsx}
- Exclude patterns: node_modules, dist, .output, convex, config files
- Coverage provider: v8 with text/json/html/lcov reporters
- Coverage thresholds: 70% for lines/functions/branches/statements
- Thread pool configured for parallelized test execution
- Path aliases (~/) automatically resolved via vite-tsconfig-paths plugin

Verification completed:
✅ vitest.config.ts file created in project root
✅ Config successfully merges with vite.config
✅ Vitest recognizes configuration without errors
✅ Include/exclude patterns working correctly
✅ No deprecation warnings (updated for Vitest 4)
✅ Changes committed to git

Next task: Configuration - Create vitest.setup.ts

### Task 3: Configuration - vitest.setup.ts ✅ COMPLETED
**Date:** 2026-01-17

Created vitest.setup.ts with global test setup and external dependency mocks:
- Imports @testing-library/jest-dom/vitest for extended matchers
- Calls cleanup() in afterEach hook for proper React component cleanup
- Mocks ~/lib/auth-client with default useSession and getSession functions
- Mocks convex/react with useQuery, useMutation, and useConvex
- Mocks window.matchMedia for theme detection tests
- All mocks return appropriate default values (null session, undefined queries)

Verification completed:
✅ vitest.setup.ts file created in project root
✅ All required imports present
✅ afterEach cleanup configured
✅ auth-client mock configured with useSession/getSession
✅ Convex mock configured with useQuery/useMutation/useConvex
✅ window.matchMedia mock configured
✅ Changes committed to git

Next task: Configuration - Update package.json with test scripts

### Task 4: Configuration - package.json Scripts ✅ COMPLETED
**Date:** 2026-01-17

Added 5 test scripts to package.json for running tests in different modes:
- test: 'vitest run' - CI mode (run once and exit)
- test:watch: 'vitest' - Watch mode (re-run on file changes)
- test:ui: 'vitest --ui' - Visual UI in browser
- test:coverage: 'vitest run --coverage' - Generate coverage report
- test:coverage:watch: 'vitest --coverage' - Watch mode with coverage

Verification completed:
✅ All 5 test scripts added to package.json
✅ Scripts correctly call vitest with appropriate flags
✅ npm test runs vitest in CI mode
✅ Scripts recognized by npm run command
✅ Tests exit with code 1 when no test files exist (expected behavior)

Next task: Configuration - Update .gitignore to exclude coverage artifacts

### Task 5: Configuration - .gitignore ✅ COMPLETED
**Date:** 2026-01-17

Updated .gitignore to exclude Vitest coverage artifacts:
- Added coverage/ directory to .gitignore
- Added .vitest/ directory to .gitignore
- Entries added under "# Vitest" section for clarity

Verification completed:
✅ .gitignore contains 'coverage/' entry
✅ .gitignore contains '.vitest/' entry
✅ Git status confirms coverage files will be ignored
✅ Changes committed to git

Next task: Example Tests - Create date utility function tests

### Task 6: Example Tests - Date Utility ✅ COMPLETED
**Date:** 2026-01-17

Created src/utils/date.test.ts with comprehensive tests for all date utility functions:
- dateToLocalDateTime: 2 tests (standard format + single-digit padding)
- localDateTimeToISO: 1 test (ISO format conversion with regex validation)
- formatDateTime: 1 test (full date/time format with component checks)
- formatTime: 1 test (time-only format validation)
- createDateWithTime: 2 tests (full params + default minutes)

Test structure:
- Uses describe/it/expect structure with Vitest globals
- Tests verify output formats using regex patterns
- Tests check edge cases like single-digit padding
- Total: 7 tests (exceeds the 6 required)

Verification completed:
✅ src/utils/date.test.ts file created
✅ All 7 tests pass (npm test date.test.ts)
✅ Tests use describe/it/expect structure
✅ Tests verify output formats with regex patterns
✅ Tests check edge cases like single-digit padding

Next task: Example Tests - Create Badge component tests

### Task 7: Example Tests - Badge Component ✅ COMPLETED
**Date:** 2026-01-17

Created src/components/ui/badge.test.tsx with comprehensive tests for all Badge variants:
- Default variant: Tests bg-primary and text-primary-foreground classes
- Secondary variant: Tests bg-secondary and text-secondary-foreground classes
- Destructive variant: Tests bg-destructive and text-destructive-foreground classes
- Outline variant: Tests text-foreground class (no background)
- Custom className: Tests className merging with default variant classes
- Additional props: Tests data-testid and role attributes pass through

Test structure:
- Uses render and screen from @testing-library/react
- Uses toBeInTheDocument and toHaveClass matchers from jest-dom
- Tests verify correct CSS classes for each variant
- Total: 6 tests (matches requirement)

Verification completed:
✅ src/components/ui/badge.test.tsx file created
✅ All 6 tests pass (npm test badge.test.tsx)
✅ Tests use render and screen from @testing-library/react
✅ Tests use toBeInTheDocument and toHaveClass matchers
✅ Tests verify correct CSS classes for each variant

Next task: Example Tests - Create useCurrentUser hook tests

### Task 8: Example Tests - useCurrentUser Hook ✅ COMPLETED
**Date:** 2026-01-17

Created src/hooks/useCurrentUser.test.ts with comprehensive tests for useCurrentUser and useRequireAuth hooks:

**useCurrentUser tests (3 tests):**
- Unauthenticated state: Returns null user/userId, isLoading false, isAuthenticated false
- Authenticated state: Returns user object, userId, isLoading false, isAuthenticated true
- Loading state: Returns null user/userId, isLoading true, isAuthenticated false

**useRequireAuth tests (2 tests):**
- Throws error when requireUserId called without authentication
- Returns userId when requireUserId called with authentication

Test structure:
- Uses renderHook from @testing-library/react
- Mocks authClient.useSession with vi.mocked for type-safe mocking
- Uses beforeEach to clear mocks between tests
- Total: 5 tests across 2 describe blocks

Verification completed:
✅ src/hooks/useCurrentUser.test.ts file created
✅ All 5 tests pass (npm test useCurrentUser.test.ts)
✅ Full test suite passes (18 tests: 7 date + 6 badge + 5 useCurrentUser)
✅ Tests use renderHook and vi.mocked patterns
✅ Mocks are properly cleared between tests

Next task: Example Tests - Create cn() utility tests
